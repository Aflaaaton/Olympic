Hello Dear Reader,
This is a sample project undertaken with the intention of practicing complex data analysis. The dataset used in it is taken from Kaggle and is about Olympics. It contain data on athletes, countries,sports and event over the year up until 2016.
As the olympics 2024 is underway so I thought why not show our love for this global sporting league by getting our hands dirty.
I hope you like it.
Thank you!
